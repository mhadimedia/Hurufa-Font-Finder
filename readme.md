# Hurufa: Font Organizer

## The perfect font, every time.
I hate searching for fonts to use in projects. Font Book is very unorganized and hard to use. I also hate the idea of downloading a font only to find out it's not what I want. Using AI, the goal of Hurufa is to make it easy to find the perfect font for your project. 

To get started, head to the Releases section and download the latest version of Hurufa.

## Features

- Find fonts installed in your system by name or category
- Organize fonts into custom tags
- Preview fonts in real-time

### Upcoming
- AI-powered font tagging
- Description based font recommendation
- Image based font recommendation
- Font finder from any text on your screen
- Sync fonts across devices
- Cloud storage integration
- Integration with Google Fonts and other font providers
- Icon libraries: all major icon libraries in one place with SVG and PNG versions
